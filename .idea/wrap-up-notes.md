# Lessons
- modern IDEs can do more than you expect
- thinking at a higher level (e.g. "extract method" rather than a series of text edits)
- undo and history also works at a structural level
- the development environment becomes, in effect, part of the language. 
This goes back to Lisp and Smalltalk
- it's frustratingly not perfect
- sometimes it's magical
- sometimes it getting there can be indirect
- Defactoring is a thing
